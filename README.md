## Hello world 🇺🇸 Hola mundo 🇲🇽 Witaj świecie 🇵🇱

### I'm Jaron.

I like hot kitchens, warm keyboards, and cold poker rooms. I am a passionate software developer with a creative mindset. I choose the rewarding path before the short path and have traveled many of them. I've lived in 3 countries and 5 cities in my previous journeys as a professional chef but have finally found my way home. You can now find me buried under lines of code in sunny San Diego.

I've spent my free time building projects, honing my craft, and learning new languages. I am fluent in JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, Flask, Express, Postgres, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, HTML, CSS, Docker, and dabble in a little Polish. Other skills include choosing the correct size Tupperware the first time and sniffing out the closest parking spot.

I wake up excited every morning to see how the tech industry is making the world a better, more enjoyable place and how my code can contribute, one line at a time. And sandwiches. I'll wake up for a good sandwich.
